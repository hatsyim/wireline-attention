# Wireline Attention
This repository contains codes and resources to reproduce Wireline Attention project. The project itself was made for ErSE 222 - Machine Learning in 
Geoscience course in KAUST as the final project.

## 0. Introduction
Mainly inspired by FORCE 2020 Facies Prediction competition (https://github.com/bolgebrygg/Force-2020-Machine-Learning-competition), we aim to seek a 
better solution for petrophysical analysis workflow. Thus, we propose an integrated petrophysical analysis workflow which we call Wireline Attention (or
WAtt in short).
